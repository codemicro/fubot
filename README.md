An April Fool's Discord bot to annoy everyone.

This bot will repeat every message sent in any channel you specify.

> *i was like "yo make a bot that repeats everything back" and tom was like "k" and i was like "you're gon do it?" and tom was like "yeh"*

This bot will only do anything if the day and month are 1 and 4 respectively.

## Setup

This script requires Python 3.6 or later.

* Install `discord.py` using `pip`.
